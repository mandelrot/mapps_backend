You can add any module you want here, and (after restarting the backend)
they will be available to be called from the frontend apps webpages 
via the 'utils' socket channel. This will be useful if you want to have
some tools commonly used in your webapps.

You can use the modules already existing in this folder as a format
example, and anyway you'll find all the info in the docs.
