  <title>Minimal app</title>

<body style="padding: 40px;">

  <h2>This is an example of a minimal frontend app for the Mandelrot Apps engine</h2>
  
  <p>It has just the elements required in order to be recognized and detected by the backend, and does nothing: it's just to let you know which file structure is required and unskippable. Anything beyond this is up to you.</p>


  <p style="margin-top: 40px;">
    The backend implements a socket communications service ready to be used by the frontend apps like this one (see docs). However it's not included in this example because the purpose of it is to show you just which files are strictly needed to be recognized as a part of the apps suite.
