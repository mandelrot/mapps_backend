  <h2>How to use backend modules</h2>
  <p>Each app has its own function modules (two files called "internal.js" and "external.js" located in its own "backend of the app package"), and they can use some basic modules provided by the server or use their own (having them in subfolders and just requiring them).</p>

  <p>Besides this, the server has a public folder (/utils/public) where there are some common utilities modules too, with functions that can be called directly from the frontend (from the browser itself) with an specific "utils" socket event.</p>
  <p>So there are two ways to use Node Modules from your app. Here will see examples of them:</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 15px;">- First, this webpage will ask directly to the server (the actual backend) to encrypt a text. The backend will look for the generic /utils/public/encryption.js module, use it to cipher the text, and send it back.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 15px;">- Second, this webpage will ask its own internal.js module to use a self-contained encryption module in the frontend folder. The internal.js module will require its own module, cipher the text, and send it back.</p>

  <span>Write something here and press the buttons below:</span>
  <input type="text" id="inputToEncript">

  <br/><br/><br/>

  <button onclick="sendToUtilsFromBrowser()">Use the backend generic encryption module</button>
  <p id="encryptedFromBrowser">The encrypted text (coming from the backend) will appear here.</p>

  <br/>

  <button onclick="sendToUtilsFromInternalJS()">Send to internal.js to require encription from there</button>
  <p id="encryptedFromInternalJs">The encrypted text (coming from internal.js) will appear here.</p>


  <br/>

  <p>IMPORTANT: the frontend apps may use their own packages as said. But the encryption is a special case, because it needs an "encryption password" and if someone uses the backend encryption module (with its password) and then someone else uses an independent encryption module (with a different password) they both will not be able to work together. The developer must choose between encryption modularity or encryption coherence for their frontend apps.</p>
